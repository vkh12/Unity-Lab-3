# Unity & Blender - Lab 3
Scripting is used to manipulate objects within a scene and have a player able to dynamically interact with that scence. Both Blender and Unity are used together to create a dynamic scene. 

In this lab, I chose to create a maze with a ball as the moving object that the player can control. 

Attached is my Unity file, Lab Guide, and Report.
